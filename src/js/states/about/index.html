    	<p>The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is the area where houses meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation. This makes the WUI a focal area for human-environment conflicts such as wildland fires, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and biodiversity decline.</p>
<p></p>Using geographic information systems (GIS), we integrated U.S. Census (2010) and USGS National Land Cover Data (2006), to map the Federal Register definition of WUI (Federal Register 66:751, 2001) for the conterminous United States. These data are useful within a GIS for mapping and analysis at national, state, and local levels.</p></p>
